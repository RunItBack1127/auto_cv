# AutoCV Backend
Backend for the AutoCV cover letter generator, implemented using Node.js and Puppeteer, and hosted on Heroku.

## How To Use
The API returns a PDF generated by the Chromium print to PDF functionality accessed by Puppeteer, containing text modified by the provided parameters.
```
Endpoint
    Method    GET
    Name      generate

Parameters:
    nameOfRole            Name of applicant role
    jobTitleStart         First word of job title
    jobTitleEnd           Second word of job title
    companyName           Name of company
```
**Example**
```
https://autocv-backend.herokuapp.com/generate?nameOfRole=[NOR]&jobTitleStart=[JTS]&jobTitleEnd=[JTE]&companyName=[CN]
```

***NOTE*** - Due to the way the PDF is generated, the name of role parameter should be no longer than 2 words or approximately 20 characters. Additionally, the job title start and end parameters should be no longer than 10 characters each of one single word. Using words and a number of characters outside of these constraints can lead to undefined visual behavior in the returned PDF.
